## ðŸ”¹ 1. Infix â†’ Postfix (Operators between operands â†’ Operators after operands)

**Pattern:**

* Use a **stack for operators**.
* **Operands** â†’ directly add to output.
* **Operator** â†’ push on stack, but first pop higher/equal precedence operators from stack.
* **Left Parenthesis `(`** â†’ push to stack.
* **Right Parenthesis `)`** â†’ pop until `(` is found.
* At end â†’ pop remaining operators.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key pattern**:
`Operand â†’ Output`
`Operator â†’ Compare precedence â†’ Stack`
`(` â†’ Push
`)` â†’ Pop until `(`

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Infix â†’ Prefix (Operators before operands)

**Pattern (shortcut trick):**

1. Reverse the infix expression.
2. Swap `(` with `)`.
3. Convert this to postfix.
4. Reverse the result.

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Postfix â†’ Infix (Operators after operands â†’ Operators between operands)

**Pattern:**

* Use a **stack for expressions**.
* **Operand** â†’ push.
* **Operator** â†’ pop 2 operands (right first, then left), form `(left operator right)` and push back.
* End â†’ stack top is full infix.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key pattern**:
`Operand â†’ Push`
`Operator â†’ Pop right + left â†’ (left op right)`

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Prefix â†’ Infix (Operators before operands â†’ Operators between operands)

**Pattern:**

* Scan expression **right to left**.
* **Operand** â†’ push.
* **Operator** â†’ pop 2 operands (left first, then right), form `(left operator right)` and push back.
* End â†’ stack top is full infix.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key pattern**:
`Operand â†’ Push`
`Operator â†’ Pop left + right â†’ (left op right)`
(scan right to left)

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Postfix â†’ Prefix

**Pattern:**

* Scan left to right.
* **Operand** â†’ push.
* **Operator** â†’ pop 2 operands (right first, then left), form `operator + left + right` and push back.
* End â†’ prefix expression in stack.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key pattern**:
`Operand â†’ Push`
`Operator â†’ Pop right + left â†’ op + left + right`

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Prefix â†’ Postfix

**Pattern:**

* Scan right to left.
* **Operand** â†’ push.
* **Operator** â†’ pop 2 operands (left first, then right), form `left + right + operator` and push back.
* End â†’ postfix expression in stack.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key pattern**:
`Operand â†’ Push`
`Operator â†’ Pop left + right â†’ left + right + op`
(scan right to left)
